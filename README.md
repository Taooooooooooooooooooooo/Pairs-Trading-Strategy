# Pairs-Trading-Strategy
Pairs Trading Strategy using Engle-Granger test, Z-scores, Sharpe ratio &amp; drawdown evaluation.
In this report, we have drawn up a pair trading strategy. By Engle-Granger test, we selected two stocks SPDR and iShares for a mean-reverting spread. We tested the strategy by changing the entry/exit Z scores and compared the Sharpe ratio and max drawdown. We found that by setting the entry Z score to 2 and exist Z score to 1, the Sharpe ratio reached the maximum 1.605.
